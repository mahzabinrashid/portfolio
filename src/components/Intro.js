      <p>
        Iâ€™m a second-year student at the <span>University of Waterloo</span>{" "}

        I previously worked at <span>Modumate</span>, a startup based in San
        Francisco as the only self-managed <span>frontend engineer</span> of the
        team. Most recently, I worked on <span>Coffee Hours</span>, a
